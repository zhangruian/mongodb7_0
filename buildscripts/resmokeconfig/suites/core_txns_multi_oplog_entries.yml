# This test suite exercises core, generic transactions behavior using the multiple transactions
# oplog entry format. The tests in this suite, pulled from 'jstests/core/txns', should be "topology
# agnostic". They ideally generalize to single replica sets and sharded clusters. Since transactions
# aren't supported on MongoDB standalones in 4.0, we run this set of tests in their own suite,
# against a 1-node replica set, to provide the most basic layer of test coverage. This allows us to
# verify basic transaction behavior against a local node, without the need to exercise data
# replication machinery.
