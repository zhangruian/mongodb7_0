.IP "Mac OSX Sierra and Go 1.6 Incompatibility"
.sp
Users running on Mac OSX Sierra require the 3.2.10 or newer version
of  mongodump\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fI\%mongodump\fP is a utility for creating a binary export of the
contents of a database. \fI\%mongodump\fP can export data from
either \fBmongod\fP or \fBmongos\fP instances.
.sp
\fI\%mongodump\fP can be a part of a backup strategy with \fBmongorestore\fP for partial
backups based on a query, syncing from production to staging or
development environments, or changing the storage engine of a
standalone. However, the use of \fI\%mongodump\fP and
\fBmongorestore\fP as a backup strategy can be problematic for
sharded clusters and replica sets.
.sp
Run \fI\%mongodump\fP from the system command line, not the \fBmongo\fP shell.
.sp
For an overview of \fI\%mongodump\fP in conjunction with
\fBmongorestore\fP part of a backup and recovery strategy, see
/tutorial/backup\-and\-restore\-tools\&.

.SH BEHAVIOR
.SS Data Exclusion
.sp
\fI\%mongodump\fP excludes the content of the \fBlocal\fP database in its output.
.sp
\fI\%mongodump\fP only captures the documents in the database in its
backup data and does not include index data. \fBmongorestore\fP or
\fBmongod\fP must then rebuild the indexes after restoring data.
.sp
Changed in version 3.4: MongoDB 3.4 added support for
read\-only views\&. By default,
\fI\%mongodump\fP only captures a view’s metadata: it does not
create a binary export of the documents included in the view. To
capture the documents in a view use \fI\%\-\-viewsAsCollections\fP\&.

.SS Read Preference
.SS Replica Sets
.sp
Changed in version 3.2.0: The choice of target or targets for the \fI\%\-\-host\fP
parameter affects the read preference of \fI\%mongodump\fP
when connecting to a replica set.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If the string passed to \fB\-\-host\fP is prefixed by the replica set name,
\fI\%mongodump\fP reads from the \fBprimary\fP replica set
member by default. For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-host "replSet/rep1.example.net:27017,rep2.example.net:27017,rep3.example.net:27017"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
If the string passed to \fB\-\-host\fP contains a list of
\fBmongod\fP instances, but does not include the replica set
name as a prefix to the host string, \fI\%mongodump\fP
reads from the \fBnearest\fP node by default. For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-host "rep1.example.net:27017,rep2.example.net:27017,rep3.example.net:27017"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.SS Sharded Clusters
.sp
Changed in version 3.0.5: For a sharded cluster where the shards are replica sets,
\fI\%mongodump\fP no longer prefers reads from secondary
members when run against the \fBmongos\fP instance.

.sp
For sharded clusters, specify the hostname of a \fBmongos\fP
for the \fB\-\-host\fP option.
\fI\%mongodump\fP reads from the \fBprimary\fP replica set
member on each shard replica set in the cluster.
.sp
Unsharded collections in a sharded cluster are stored on a
primary shard\&.
\fI\%mongodump\fP reads from the primary replica set member on
the primary shard for any unsharded collections. Note: each
database has its own primary shard.
.SS Overwrite Files
.sp
\fI\%mongodump\fP overwrites output files if they exist in the
backup data folder. Before running the \fI\%mongodump\fP command
multiple times, either ensure that you no longer need the files in the
output folder (the default is the \fBdump/\fP folder) or rename the
folders or files.
.SS Data Compression Handling
.sp
When run against a \fBmongod\fP instance that uses the
WiredTiger storage engine,
\fI\%mongodump\fP outputs uncompressed data.
.SS Working Set
.sp
\fI\%mongodump\fP can adversely affect performance of the
\fBmongod\fP\&. If your data is larger than system memory, the
\fI\%mongodump\fP will push the working set out of memory.
.SH REQUIRED ACCESS
.sp
To run \fI\%mongodump\fP against a MongoDB deployment that has
access control enabled, you must have
privileges that grant \fBfind\fP action for each database to
back up. The built\-in \fBbackup\fP role provides the required
privileges to perform backup of any and all databases.
.sp
Changed in version 3.2.1: The \fBbackup\fP role provides additional privileges to back
up the \fBsystem.profile\fP
collection that exists when running with database profiling\&. Previously, users required
\fBread\fP access on this collection.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
Changed in version 3.0.0: \fI\%mongodump\fP removed the \fB\-\-dbpath\fP as well as related
\fB\-\-directoryperdb\fP and \fB\-\-journal\fP options. To use
\fI\%mongodump\fP, you must run \fI\%mongodump\fP against a running
\fBmongod\fP or \fBmongos\fP instance as appropriate.

.sp
Starting in version 3.4, if \fB\-\-sslCAFile\fP or \fBssl.CAFile\fP is not
specified and you are not using x.509 authentication, the
system\-wide CA certificate store will be used when connecting to an
TLS/SSL\-enabled server.

warning the use of the invalid certificate.
.sp
Starting in MongoDB 4.0, if you specify
\fB\-\-sslAllowInvalidCertificates\fP or \fBssl.allowInvalidCertificates:
true\fP when using x.509 authentication, an invalid certificate is
only sufficient to establish a TLS/SSL connection but is

Changes the behavior of \fBmongodump\fP to only write valid data and
exclude data that may be in an invalid state as a result of an
improper shutdown or \fBmongod\fP crash.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-repair\fP is different from \fBmongod \-\-repair\fP, and may produce
a large amount of duplicate documents. It is only available for use
against \fBmongod\fP instances using the \fBmmapv1\fP storage
engine. You cannot run \fI\%\-\-repair\fP against \fBmongos\fP, or against
\fBmongod\fP instances that use the \fBwiredTiger\fP storage
engine.

.B \-\-oplog
Creates a file named \fBoplog.bson\fP as part of the
\fI\%mongodump\fP output. The \fBoplog.bson\fP file, located in
the top level of the output directory, contains oplog entries that
occur during the \fI\%mongodump\fP operation. This file provides
an effective point\-in\-time snapshot of the state of a
\fBmongod\fP instance. To restore to a specific point\-in\-time
backup, use the output created with this option in conjunction with
\fBmongorestore \-\-oplogReplay\fP\&.
.sp
Without \fI\%\-\-oplog\fP, if there are write operations during the dump
operation, the dump will not reflect a single moment in time. Changes
made to the database during the update process can affect the output of
the backup.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-oplog\fP has no effect when running \fI\%mongodump\fP
against a \fBmongos\fP instance to dump the entire contents of a
sharded cluster. However, you can use \fI\%\-\-oplog\fP to dump
individual shards.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-oplog\fP only works against nodes that maintain an
oplog\&. This includes all members of a replica set.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-oplog\fP does not dump the oplog collection.

To use \fI\%mongodump\fP with \fI\%\-\-oplog\fP, you must create a full dump of
a replica set member. \fI\%mongodump\fP with  \fI\%\-\-oplog\fP fails

Includes user and role definitions in the database’s dump directory
when performing \fI\%mongodump\fP on a specific database. This
option applies only when you specify a database in the

.B \-\-viewsAsCollections
New in version 3.4.

.sp
When specified, \fBmongodump\fP exports read\-only views as collections. For each view, \fBmongodump\fP will
produce a BSON file containing the documents in the view. If you
\fBmongorestore\fP the produced BSON file, the view will be
restored as a collection\&.
.sp
If you do \fInot\fP include \fI\%\-\-viewsAsCollections\fP,
\fBmongodump\fP captures each view’s metadata. If you include a
view’s metadata file in a \fBmongorestore\fP operation, the view
is recreated.
