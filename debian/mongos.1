.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fI\%mongos\fP for “MongoDB Shard,” is a routing service for
MongoDB shard configurations that processes queries from the
application layer, and determines the location of this data in the
sharded cluster, in order to complete these operations.
From the perspective of the application, a
\fI\%mongos\fP instance behaves identically to any other MongoDB
instance.

.B \-\-maxConns <number>
The maximum number of simultaneous connections that \fBmongos\fP will
accept. This setting has no effect if it is higher than your operating
system’s configured maximum connection tracking threshold.
.sp
Do not assign too low of a value to this option, or you will
encounter errors during normal application operation.
.sp
This is particularly useful for a \fI\%mongos\fP if you have a client
that creates multiple connections and allows them to timeout rather
than closing them.
.sp
In this case, set \fBmaxIncomingConnections\fP to a value slightly
higher than the maximum number of connections that the client creates, or the
maximum size of the connection pool.
.sp
This setting prevents the \fI\%mongos\fP from causing connection spikes on
the individual shards\&. Spikes like these may disrupt the
operation and memory allocation of the sharded cluster\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0

.sp
The \fI\%\-\-syslog\fP option is not supported on Windows.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBsyslog\fP daemon generates timestamps when it logs a message, not
when MongoDB issues the message. This can lead to misleading timestamps
for log entries, especially when the system is under heavy load. We
recommend using the \fI\%\-\-logpath\fP option for production systems to
ensure accurate timestamps.

.B \-\-syslogFacility <string>
\fIDefault\fP: user
.sp
Specifies the facility level used when logging messages to syslog.

must  enable the \fI\%\-\-syslog\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-logpath <path>
Sends all diagnostic logging information to a log file instead of to
standard output or to the host’s syslog system. MongoDB creates
the log file at the path you specify.
.sp
By default, MongoDB will move any existing log file rather than overwrite
it. To instead append to the log file, set the \fI\%\-\-logappend\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-logappend
Appends new entries to the end of the existing log file when the \fBmongos\fP

.B \-\-redactClientLogData
New in version 3.4: Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

.sp
A \fBmongos\fP running with \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP redacts any message accompanying a given
log event before logging. This prevents the \fBmongos\fP from writing
potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log.
Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file
names are still visible in the logs.
.sp
Use \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP in conjunction with encryption to assist compliance with regulatory
requirements.
.sp
For example, a MongoDB deployment might store Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in one or more collections. The \fBmongos\fP logs events
such as those related to CRUD operations, sharding metadata, etc. It is
possible that the \fBmongos\fP may expose PII as a part of these logging
operations. A \fBmongos\fP running with \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP removes any message
accompanying these events before being output to the log, effectively
removing the PII.
.sp
Diagnostics on a \fBmongos\fP running with \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP may be more difficult
due to the lack of data related to a log event. See the
process logging manual page for an
example of the effect of \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP on log output.
.sp
You can enable or disable log redaction on a running \fBmongos\fP
using the \fBsetParameter\fP database command.

typically you will run \fBmongos\fP as a daemon, either by using

.B \-\-transitionToAuth
New in version 3.4: Allows the \fBmongos\fP to accept and create authenticated and
non\-authenticated connections to and from other \fBmongod\fP
and \fI\%mongos\fP instances in the deployment. Used for
performing rolling transition of replica sets or sharded clusters
from a no\-auth configuration to internal authentication\&. Requires specifying a internal
authentication mechanism such as
\fI\%\-\-keyFile\fP\&.

.sp
For example, if using keyfiles for
internal authentication, the \fBmongos\fP creates
an authenticated connection with any \fBmongod\fP or \fI\%mongos\fP
in the deployment using a matching keyfile. If the security mechanisms do
not match, the \fBmongos\fP utilizes a non\-authenticated connection instead.
.sp
A \fBmongos\fP running with \fI\%\-\-transitionToAuth\fP does not enforce user access
controls\&. Users may connect to your deployment without any
access control checks and perform read, write, and administrative operations.

.IP \(bu 2

If you specify multiple compressors, then the order in which you list
the compressors matter as well as the communication initiator. For
example, if a \fBmongo\fP shell specifies the following network
compressors \fBzlib,snappy\fP and the \fBmongod\fP specifies
\fBsnappy,zlib\fP, messages between \fBmongo\fP shell and
\fBmongod\fP uses \fBzlib\fP\&.
.sp
If the parties do not share at least one common compressor, messages
between the parties are uncompressed. For example, if a
\fBmongo\fP shell specifies the network compressor
\fBzlib\fP and \fBmongod\fP specifies \fBsnappy\fP, messages
between \fBmongo\fP shell and \fBmongod\fP are not compressed.

When performing authentication or authorization, \fBmongos\fP steps through
each document in the array in the given order, checking the authentication
username against the \fBmatch\fP filter.  If a match is found,
\fBmongos\fP applies the transformation and uses the output for
authenticating the user. \fBmongos\fP does not check the remaining documents
in the array.
.sp
If the given document does not match the provided authentication name, or
the transformation described by the document fails, \fBmongos\fP continues
through the list of documents to find additional matches. If no matches are
found in any document, \fBmongos\fP returns an error.

The following shows two transformation documents. The first
document matches against any string ending in \fB@ENGINEERING\fP, placing
anything preceeding the suffix into a regex capture group. The
second document matches against any string ending in \fB@DBA\fP, placing
anything preceeding the suffix into a regex capture group.

A user with username \fBalice@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM\fP matches the first
document. The regex capture group \fB{0}\fP corresponds to the string
\fBalice\fP\&. The resulting output is the DN
\fB"cn=alice,ou=engineering,dc=example,dc=com"\fP\&.
.sp
A user with username \fBbob@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM\fP matches the second document.
The regex capture group \fB{0}\fP corresponds to the string \fBbob\fP\&.  The
resulting output is the LDAP query
\fB"ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com??one?(user=bob)"\fP\&. \fBmongos\fP executes this
query against the LDAP server, returning the result
\fB"cn=bob,ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com"\fP\&.
