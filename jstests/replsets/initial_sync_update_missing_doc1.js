/**
 * Initial sync runs in several phases - the first 3 are as follows:
 * 1) fetches the last oplog entry (op_start1) on the source;
 * 2) copies all non-local databases from the source; and
 * 3) fetches and applies operations from the source after op_start1.
 *
 * This test updates and deletes a document on the source between phases 1 and 2. The
 * secondary will initially fail to apply the update operation in phase 3 and subsequently have
 * to attempt to check the source for a new copy of the document. The absence of the document on
 * the source indicates that the source is free to ignore the failed update operation.
