/**
 * Initial sync runs in several phases - the first 3 are as follows:
 * 1) fetches the last oplog entry (op_start1) on the source;
 * 2) copies all non-local databases from the source; and
 * 3) fetches and applies operations from the source after op_start1.
 *
 * This test updates and deletes a document on the source between phases 1 and 2. The
 * secondary will initially fail to apply the update operation in phase 3 and subsequently have
 * to attempt to check the source for a new copy of the document. Before the secondary checks the
 * source, we insert a new copy of the document into this collection on the source and mark the
 * collection on which the document to be fetched resides as drop pending, thus effectively
 * renaming the collection but preserving the UUID. This ensures the secondary fetches the
 * document by UUID rather than namespace.
