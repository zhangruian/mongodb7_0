# MongoDB Versioned API

The MongoDB API is the user-visible behavior of all commands, including their parameters and reply
fields. An "API version" is a subset of the API for which we make an especially strong promise: For
any API version V, if an application declares API version V and uses only behaviors in V, and it is
deployed along with a specific version of an official driver, then it will experience no
semantically significant behavior changes resulting from server upgrades so long as the new server
supports V.

We can introduce compatible changes within an API version, and incompatible changes in new API
versions. Servers support multiple API versions at once; different applications can use different
API versions.

## Compatibility

For any API version V the following changes are prohibited, and must be introduced in a new API
version W.

- Remove StableCommand (where StableCommand is some command in V).
- Remove a documented StableCommand parameter.
- Prohibit a formerly permitted StableCommand parameter value.
- Remove a field from StableCommand's reply.
- Change the type of a field in StableCommand's reply, or expand the set of types it may be.
- Change semantics of StableCommand in a manner that may cause existing applications to misbehave.
- Change an error code returned in a particular error scenario, if drivers rely on the code.
- Remove a label L from an error returned in a particular error scenario which had returned an error
  labeled with L before.
- Prohibit any currently permitted CRUD syntax element, including but not limited to query and
  aggregation operators, aggregation stages and expressions, and CRUD operators.
- Remove support for a BSON type, or any other BSON format change (besides adding a type).
- Drop support for a wire protocol message type.
- Drop support for an authentication mechanism.
- Making the authorization requirements for StableCommand more restrictive.
- Increase hello.minWireVersion (or decrease maxWireVersion, which we won't do).

The following changes are permitted in V:

- Add a command.
- Add an optional command parameter.
- Permit a formerly prohibited command parameter or parameter value.
- Any change in an undocumented command parameter.
- Change any aspect of internal sharding/replication/etc. protocols.
- Add a command reply field.
- Add a new error code (provided this does not break compatibility with existing drivers and
  applications).
- Add a label to an error.
- Change order of fields in reply docs and sub-docs.
- Add a CRUD syntax element.
- Making the authorization requirements for StableCommand less restrictive.
- Deprecate a behavior
- Increase hello.maxWireVersion.
- Any change in behaviors not in V.
- Performance changes.

## Versioned API implementation

All `Command` subclasses implement `apiVersions()`, which returns the set of API versions the
command is part of. By default, a command is not included in any API version, meaning it has no
special backward compatibility guarantees. `Command` subclasses also implement
`deprecatedApiVersions()`, which returns the set of API versions in which the command is deprecated.
This is a subset of `apiVersions()`.

## API version parameters

All commands accept three parameters: apiVersion, apiStrict, and apiDeprecationErrors. Users
configure their drivers to add these parameters to each command invocation. These parameters express
which version of the MongoDB API the user requests, whether to permit invocations of commands that
are not in any API version, and whether to permit deprecated behaviors. If a behavior has changed
between API versions, the server uses the client's apiVersion parameter to choose how to behave. The
API version parameters are all optional, except if the server parameter requireApiVersion is true:
then all commands require apiVersion.

The default apiVersion is "1". In the future we can remove the default and make apiVersion a
required parameter for all commands. We can never change the default, however.

## Dropping API versions

To drop an API version U, we must publish at least one server release R that supports both U and
some newer API version V. It must support both versions in R's fully upgraded FCV (see below). This
gives users the opportunity to update their code to use V without downtime.

## Deprecation

We can deprecate behaviors (which include commands, command parameters, etc.) in V in any server
release R. We should deprecate a behavior if we plan to remove it in a later API version. Ideally,
if R supports API versions V and W, and a user's code runs with no deprecation errors in V on R,
then the user can upgrade to W on R with no further code changes. In some cases, however, there will
be incompatible changes in W that can't be foretold by deprecations in V.

## featureCompatibilityVersion (FCV)

Rules for feature compatibility version and API version:

### Rule 1

**The first release to support an API version W can add W in its upgraded FCV, but cannot add W in
  its downgraded FCV.**

Some API versions will introduce behaviors that require disk format changes or intracluster protocol
changes that don't take effect until setFCV("R"), so for consistency, we always wait for setFCV("R")
before supporting a new API version.

### Rule 2

**So that applications can upgrade without downtime from V to W, at least one release must support
  both V and W in its upgraded FCV.**

This permits zero-downtime API version upgrades. If release R in its upgraded FCV "R" supports both
V and W, the customer can first upgrade to R with FCV "R" while their application is running with
API version V, then redeploy their application with the code updated to W while the server is
running.

It isn't sufficient for a binary release to support V and W in its downgraded FCV, because cloud
users have no control over when a binary-upgraded server executes setFCV("R"). The server must
support both API versions in its upgraded FCV, because this is its steady state.
