/**
 * ReplicaSetAwareServices are those that need to respond to changes in per-node replication state,
 * such as becoming primary, stepping down, and entering rollback.
 *
 * Using this interface avoids the need to manually hook the various places in
 * ReplicationCoordinatorExternalStateImpl where these events occur.
 *
 * To define a ReplicaSetAwareService, a class needs to inherit from ReplicaSetAwareService
 * (templated on itself), implement the pure virtual methods in ReplicaSetAwareInterface, and define
 * a static ReplicaSetAwareServiceRegistry::Registerer to declare the name (and optionally
 * pre-requisite services) of the service.
 *
 * If the service should only be active in certain configurations, then the class should override
 * shouldRegisterReplicaSetAwareService.  For the common cases of services that are only active on
 * config servers, the class can inherit from ReplicaSetAwareServiceConfigSvr (instead of
 * ReplicaSetAwareService).  Similarly, shard-only services can inherit from
 * ReplicaSetAwareServiceShardSvr.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * #include "mongo/db/replica_set_aware_service.h"
 *
 * class FooService : public ReplicaSetAwareService<FooService> {
 * public:
 *     // ...
 *
 * private:
 *     // Optional:
 *     virtual bool shouldRegisterReplicaSetAwareService() const final {
 *         return ...;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Mandatory:
 *     void onStepUpBegin(OperationContext* opCtx) final {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     void onStepUpComplete(OperationContext* opCtx) final {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *     void onStepDown() final {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * };
 *
 * namespace {
 *
 * ReplicaSetAwareServiceRegistry::Registerer<FooService> fooServiceRegisterer("FooService");
 *
 * }  // namespace
