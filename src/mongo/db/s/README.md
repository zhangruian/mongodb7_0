# Sharding Internals

## Recommended prerequisite reading

A reader should be familiar with the
[**general concept**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/#sharding)
of horizontal scaling or "sharding", the
[**architecture of a MongoDB sharded cluster**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/#sharded-cluster),
and the concept of a
[**shard key in MongoDB**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/#shard-keys).

# Routing

There is an authoritative routing table stored on the config server replica set, and all nodes cache
the routing table in memory so that they can route requests to the shard(s) that own the
corresponding data.

## The authoritative routing table

The authoritative routing table is stored in a set of unsharded collections in the config database
on the config server replica set. The schemas of the relevant collections are:

* [**config.databases**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/config-database/#config.databases)
* [**config.collections**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/config-database/#config.collections)
* [**config.chunks**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/config-database/#config.chunks)
* [**config.shards**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/config-database/#config.shards)

#### Code references

* The
[**indexes created**](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/r4.3.4/src/mongo/db/s/config/sharding_catalog_manager.cpp#L295-L372)
on each of these collections for efficient querying

## The routing table cache

The routing table cache is a read-only in-memory cache. This cache keeps track of the last-seen
routing information for databases and sharded collections in a sharded cluster. An independent
copy of the routing table cache exists on each router and shard.

Operations consult the routing table cache in order to route requests to shards that hold data for
a collection.

### How the routing table cache refreshes

The authoritative routing information exists persisted to disk on the config server. Certain node
types load information (refresh) directly from the config server. Other node types refresh from an
intermediary source. At any given time, the state of the in-memory cache is the result of the
latest refresh from that node’s source. As a result, the cache may or may not be up-to-date with
its corresponding source.

We define the refresh behavior based on node type below:

| Node Type                             | Information Source                                          | Additional Behavior  |
| ---------                             | ------------------                                          | ------------------   |
| Router                                | Config server                                               | N/A                  |
| Shard server acting as replica set primary   | Config server                                               | Persists refreshed information to disk. This information should always be consistent with the in-memory cache. The persisted information is replicated to all replica set secondaries. |
| Shard server acting as replica set secondary | On-disk information replicated from the replica set primary | N/A                  |

When referring to a refresh in this section, we imply that the given node’s routing table cache
will update its in-memory state with its corresponding source.

### When the routing table cache will refresh

The routing table cache is “lazy.” It does not refresh from its source unless necessary. The cache
will refresh in two scenarios:

1. A request sent to a shard returns an error indicating that the shard’s known routing information for that request doesn't match the sender's routing information.
2. The cache attempts to access information for a collection that has been locally marked as having out-of-date routing information (stale).

Operations that change a collection’s routing information (for example, a moveChunk command that
updates a chunk’s location) will mark the local node’s routing table cache as “stale” for affected
shards. Subsequent attempts to access routing information for affected shards will block on a
routing table cache refresh. Some operations, such as dropCollection, will affect all shards. In
this case, the entire collection will be marked as “stale.” Accordingly, subsequent attempts to
access any routing information for the collection will block on a routing table cache refresh.

### Types of refreshes

The routing table cache performs two types of refreshes for a database or collection.

1. A full refresh clears all cached information, and replaces the cache with the information that exists on the node’s source.
2. An incremental refresh only replaces modified routing information from the node’s source.

An incremental refresh occurs when the routing table cache already has a local notion of the
collection or database. A full refresh occurs when:

* The cache has no notion of a collection or database, or
* A collection or database has been marked as dropped by a shard or the local node’s routing information, or
* A collection has otherwise been marked as having a mismatched epoch.

### Operational Caveats

1. If the routing table cache receives an error in attempting to refresh, it will retry up to twice before giving up and returning stale information.
2. If the gEnableFinerGrainedCatalogCacheRefresh startup parameter is disabled, then all attempts to access routing information for a stale namespace will block on a routing table cache refresh, regardless if a particular targeted shard is marked as stale.

## Shard versioning and database versioning

In a sharded cluster, the placement of collections is determined by a versioning protocol. We use
this versioning protocol in tracking the location of both chunks for sharded collections and
databases for unsharded collections.

### Shard versioning

The shard versioning protocol tracks the placement of chunks for sharded collections.

Each chunk has a version called the "chunk version." A chunk version consists of three elements:

1. The major version - an integer incremented when a chunk moves shards.
1. The minor version - an integer incremented when a chunk is split.
1. The epoch - an object ID shared among all chunks for a collection that distinguishes a unique instance of the collection. The epoch remains unchanged for the lifetime of the chunk, unless the collection is dropped or the collection's shard key has been refined using the refineCollectionShardKey command.

To completely define the shard versioning protocol, we introduce two extra terms - the "shard
version" and "collection version."

1. Shard version - For a sharded collection, this is the highest chunk version seen on a particular shard.
1. Collection version - For a sharded collection, this is the highest chunk version seen across all shards.

### Database versioning

The database versioning protocol tracks the placement of databases for unsharded collections. The
“database version” indicates on which shard a database currently exists. A database version
consists of two elements:

1. The UUID - a unique identifier to distinguish different instances of the database. The UUID remains unchanged for the lifetime of the database, unless the database is dropped and recreated.
1. The last modified field - an integer incremented when the database changes its primary shard.

### Versioning updates

Nodes that track chunk/database versions “lazily” load versioning information. A router or shard
will only find out that its internally-stored versioning information is stale via receiving changed
version information from another node.

For each request sent from an origin node to a remote node, the origin node will attach its cached
version information for the corresponding chunk or database. There are two possible versioning
scenarios: 

1. If the remote node detects a shard version mismatch, the remote node will return a message to the origin node stating as such. Whichever node that reports having an older version will attempt to refresh. The origin node will then retry the request.
1. If the remote node and the origin node have the same version, the request will proceed.

### Types of operations that will cause the versioning information to become stale

Operation Type                            | Version Modification Behavior                                                                                             |
--------------                            | -----------------------------                                                                                             |
Moving a chunk                            | Incremements the chunk's major version                                                                                    |
Splitting a chunk                         | If the shard version is equal to the collection version, increases the major version; always increments the minor version |
Merging a chunk                           | Sets the chunk's major version to the collection version plus one; will set the chunk's minor version to zero             |
Dropping a collection                     | Sets the chunk's version and epoch to the unsharded constant defined below                                                |
Refining a collection’s shard key         | Creates a new epoch while maintaining the chunk’s major and minor version                                                 |
Changing the primary shard for a database | Increments the database’s last modified field                                                                             |
Dropping a database                       | Creates a new UUID and set the last modified field to one                                                                 |

Refer to [SERVER-41480](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-41480) for the reasoning behind the
complicated behavior with splitting a chunk.

## The shard registry

The shard registry is an in-memory cache mirroring the `config.shards` collection on the config
server. The collection (and thus the cache) contains an entry for each shard in the cluster. Each
entry contains the connection string for that shard.

An independent cache exists on each node across all node types (router, shard server, config
server).

Retrieving a shard from the registry returns a `Shard` object. Using that object, one can access
more information about a shard and run commands against that shard. A `Shard` object can be
retrieved from the registry by using any of:

* The shard's name
* The replica set's name
* The HostAndPort object
* The connection string

The shard registry refreshes itself in these scenarios:

1. Upon the node's start-up
1. Upon completion of a background job that runs every thirty seconds
1. Upon an attempt to retrieve a shard that doesn’t have a matching entry in the cache
1. Upon calling the ShardRegistry’s reload function (ShardRegistry::reload())

The shard registry makes updates to the `config.shards` collection in one case. If the shard
registry discovers an updated connection string for another shard via a replica set topology
change, it will persist that update to `config.shards`.

## Targeting a specific host within a shard
When routing a query to a replica set, a cluster node must determine which member to target for a given read preference. A cluster node either has or creates a ReplicaSetMonitor for each remote shard to which it needs to route requests. Information from the ReplicaSetMonitor interface is used to route requests to a specific node within a shard.

Further details on replica set monitoring and host targeting can be found [here](../../../mongo/client/README.md).

# Migrations

Data is migrated from one shard to another at the granularity of a single chunk.

It is also possible to move unsharded collections as a group by changing the primary shard of a
database. This uses a protocol similar to but less robust than the one for moving a chunk, so only
moving a chunk is discussed here.

## The live migration protocol
A chunk is moved from one shard to another by the moveChunk command. This command can be issued either manually or by the balancer. The live migration protocol consists of an exchange of messages between two shards, the donor and the recipient. This exchange is orchestrated by the donor shard in the [moveChunk command](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/3f849d508692c038afb643b1acb99b8a8cb98d38/src/mongo/db/s/move_chunk_command.cpp#L214) which follows a series of steps.

1. **Start the migration** - The ActiveMigrationsRegistry is [updated on the donor side](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/3f849d508692c038afb643b1acb99b8a8cb98d38/src/mongo/db/s/move_chunk_command.cpp#L138) to reflect that a specific chunk is being moved. This prevents any other chunk migrations from happening on this shard until the migration is completed. If an existing incoming or outgoing migration is in flight then the registration will fail and the migration will be aborted. If the inflight operation is for the same chunk then the the registration call will return an object that the moveChunk command can use to join the current operation.
1. **Start cloning the chunk** - After validating the migration parameters, the donor starts the migration process by sending the _recvChunkStart message to the recipient. This causes the recipient to then [initiate the transfer of documents](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/5c72483523561c0331769abc3250cf623817883f/src/mongo/db/s/migration_destination_manager.cpp#L955) from the donor. The initial transfer of documents is done by [repeatedly sending the _migrateClone command to the donor](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/5c72483523561c0331769abc3250cf623817883f/src/mongo/db/s/migration_destination_manager.cpp#L1042) and inserting the fetched documents on the recipient.
1. **Transfer queued modifications** - Once the initial batch of documents are copied, the recipient then needs to retrieve any modifications that have been queued up on the donor. This is done by  [repeatedly sending the _transferMods command to the donor](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/5c72483523561c0331769abc3250cf623817883f/src/mongo/db/s/migration_destination_manager.cpp#L1060-L1111). These are [inserts, updates and deletes](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/11eddfac181ff6ff9faf3e1d55c050373bc6fc24/src/mongo/db/s/migration_chunk_cloner_source_legacy.cpp#L534-L550) that occurred on the donor while the initial batch was being transferred.
1. **Wait for recipient to clone documents** - The donor [polls the recipient](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/3f849d508692c038afb643b1acb99b8a8cb98d38/src/mongo/db/s/migration_chunk_cloner_source_legacy.cpp#L984) to see when the transfer of documents has been completed or the timeout has been exceeded. This is indicated when the recipient returns a state of “steady” as a result of the _recvChunkStatus command.
1. **Enter the critical section** - Once the recipient has cloned the initial documents, the donor then [declares that it is in a critical section](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/3f849d508692c038afb643b1acb99b8a8cb98d38/src/mongo/db/s/migration_source_manager.cpp#L344). This indicates that the next operations must not be interrupted and will require recovery actions if they are interrupted. Writes to the donor shard will be suspended while the critical section is in effect. The mechanism to implement the critical section writes the ShardingStateRecovery document to store the minimum optime of the sharding config metadata. If this document exists on stepup it is used to update the optime so that the correct metadata is used.
1. **Commit on the recipient** - While in the critical section, the [_recvChunkCommit](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/3f849d508692c038afb643b1acb99b8a8cb98d38/src/mongo/db/s/migration_chunk_cloner_source_legacy.cpp#L360) command is sent to the recipient directing it to fetch any remaining documents for this chunk. The recipient responds by sending _transferMods to fetch the remaining documents while writes are blocked on the donor. Once the documents are transferred successfully, the _recvChunkCommit command returns it’s status to unblock the donor.
1. **Commit on the config server** - The donor sends the _configsvrCommitChunkMigration command to the config server. Before the command is sent, [reads are also suspended](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/3f849d508692c038afb643b1acb99b8a8cb98d38/src/mongo/db/s/migration_source_manager.cpp#L436) on the donor shard.

## Orphaned range deletion
After the migration protocol moves a chunk from one shard to another, the documents that were in the moved range need to be deleted from the donor shard. If the migration failed for any reason and was aborted, then any documents that have been copied over to the recipient need to be deleted. These documents are called orphans since they're not owned by the shard they reside on.

The migration protocol handles orphaned range deletion by recording the range that is being moved into the config.rangeDeletions collection on both the donor and recipient shards. The range deletion document contains the range that is to be deleted along with a pending flag that indicates if the range is ready for deletion.

If the migration completes successfully, the range is submitted for deletion on the donor and the range deletion document is deleted from the config.rangeDeletions collection on the recipient. If the migration fails, the range deletion document is deleted from the donor and the range is submitted for deletion on the recipient.

This sequence of steps is orchestrated by the MigrationCoordinator:
1. The donor shard writes the [migration coordinator document](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/migration_coordinator_document.idl#L67-L102) to its local
config.migrationCoordinators collection. This document contains a unique ID along with other fields that are needed to recover the migration upon failure.
1. The donor shard writes the [range deletion document](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/range_deletion_task.idl#L50-L76) to its local config.rangeDeletions collection with the pending flag set to true. This will prevent the range from being deleted until it is marked as ready.
1. Before the recipient shard begins migrating documents from the donor, if there is an overlapping range already in the config.rangeDeletions collection, the recipient will [wait for it to be deleted](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/ea576519e5c3445bf11aa7f880aedbee1501010c/src/mongo/db/s/migration_destination_manager.cpp#L865-L885). The recipient then [writes a range deletion document](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/ea576519e5c3445bf11aa7f880aedbee1501010c/src/mongo/db/s/migration_destination_manager.cpp#L895) to its local config.rangeDeletions collection before the clone step begins.
1. Once the migration is completed, the MigrationCoordinator records the decision in the migration coordinator document on the donor. 
    * If the migration succeeded, then the commit sequence is executed. This involves [deleting the range deletion document on the recipient](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/migration_coordinator.cpp#L204) and then [marking the range](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/migration_coordinator.cpp#L211) as ready to be deleted on the donor. The range is then [submitted for deletion](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/migration_coordinator.cpp#L225) on the donor.
    * If the migration failed, then the abort sequence is executed. This involves [deleting the range deletion task on the donor](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/migration_coordinator.cpp#L255) and then [marking the range as ready](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/migration_coordinator.cpp#L261) to be deleted on the recipient. The range is then [submitted for deletion](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/52a73692175cad37f942ff5e6f3d70aacbbb113d/src/mongo/db/s/shard_server_op_observer.cpp#L383-L393) on the recipient by the ShardServerOpObserver when the [write is committed]((https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/52a73692175cad37f942ff5e6f3d70aacbbb113d/src/mongo/db/s/shard_server_op_observer.cpp#L131)).
1. The migration coordinator document is then [deleted](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/migration_coordinator.cpp#L270).

On either donor or recipient, the range deletion is [submitted asynchronously](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/range_deletion_util.cpp#L396) to a separate executor that maintains one thread. On the donor, there is a risk of deleting documents that are being accessed in ongoing queries. We first wait for any queries on the primary to complete by [waiting on a promise](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/52a73692175cad37f942ff5e6f3d70aacbbb113d/src/mongo/db/s/metadata_manager.h#L212-L221) that is signalled by the [reference counting mechanism](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/ab21bf5ef46689cf4503a3b089def71113c437e2/src/mongo/db/s/metadata_manager.cpp#L126) in RangePreserver and [CollectionMetadataTracker](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/52a73692175cad37f942ff5e6f3d70aacbbb113d/src/mongo/db/s/metadata_manager.h#L201). We then [wait for a specified amount of time](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/range_deletion_util.cpp#L417-L418) for any queries running on secondaries to complete before starting the deletion. The delay defaults to 15 minutes but can be configured through a server parameter. The documents in the range are then [deleted in batches](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/range_deletion_util.cpp#L312) with a [delay between each batch](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/49159e1cf859d21c767f6b582dd6e6b2d675808d/src/mongo/db/s/range_deletion_util.cpp#L338). This rate limiting is intended to reduce the I/O load from excessive deletions happening at the same time. When the deletion has been completed, the [range deletion document is deleted](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/52a73692175cad37f942ff5e6f3d70aacbbb113d/src/mongo/db/s/range_deletion_util.cpp#L485) from the local config.rangeDeletions collection.

# Auto-splitting and auto-balancing

Data may need to redistributed for many reasons, such as that a shard was added, a shard was
requested to be removed, or data was inserted in an imbalanced way.

The config server replica set durably stores settings for the maximum chunk size and whether chunks
should be automatically split and balanced.

## Auto-splitting

# DDL operations

Indexes are not stored in the routing table, so a router forwards index operations to all shards
that own chunks for the collection.

Collections are always created as unsharded, meaning they are not stored in the routing table, so
a router forwards create collection requests directly to the primary shard for the database. A
router also forwards rename collection requests directly to the primary shard, since only renaming
unsharded collections is supported.

A router forwards all other DDL operations, such as dropping a database or sharding a collection,
to the config server primary. The config server primary serializes conflicting operations, and
either itself coordinates the DDL operation or hands off the coordination to a shard. Coordinating
the DDL operation involves applying the operation on the correct set of shards and updating the
authoritative routing table.

including the logic for

operations that are otherwise coordinated by a shard.

to a shard. The business logic for such commands is in the shard's command body, such as the logic
for
[**shardCollection**](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/r4.3.4/src/mongo/db/s/shardsvr_shard_collection.cpp#L7830).

## Important caveats

### Database creation

There is no explicit command to create a database. When a router receives a write command, an entry
for the database is created in the config.databases collection if one doesn't already exist. Unlike
all other DDL operations, creating a database only involves choosing a primary shard (the shard with
the smallest total data size is chosen) and writing the database entry to the authoritative routing
table. That is, creating a database does not involve modifying any state on shards, since on shards,
a database only exists once a collection in it is created.

* Example of mongos
[**asking the config server to create a database**](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/r4.3.4/src/mongo/s/commands/cluster_create_cmd.cpp#L116)
if needed

### Retrying internally

DDL operations often involve multiple hops between nodes. Generally, if a command is idempotent on
the receiving node, the sending node will retry it upon receiving a retryable error, such as a
network or NotMaster error. There are some cases where the sending node retries even though the
command is not idempotent, such as in shardCollection. In this case, the receiving node may return
ManualInterventionRequired if the first attempt failed partway.

[**failing with ManualInterventionRequired**](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/r4.3.4/src/mongo/db/s/shardsvr_shard_collection.cpp#L129)

### Serializing conflicting operations

The concurrency control scheme has evolved over time and involves several different locks.

Distributed locks are locks on a string resource, typically a database name or collection name. They
are acquired by doing a majority write to a document in the `config.locks` collection on the config
servers. The write includes the identity of the process acquiring the lock. The process holding a
distributed lock must also periodically "ping" (update) a document in the `config.lockpings`
collection on the config servers containing its process id. If the process's document is not pinged
for 15 minutes or more, the process's distributed locks are allowed to be "overtaken" by another
process. Note that this means a distributed lock can be overtaken even though the original process
that had acquired the lock continues to believe it owns the lock. See
[**this blog post**](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html) for
an excellent description of the distributed locking problem.

In the first implementation of distributed locks, a thread would wait for a lock to be released by
polling the lock document every 500 milliseconds for 20 seconds (and return a LockBusy error if the
thread never saw the lock as available.) NamespaceSerializer locks were introduced to allow a thread
to be notified more efficiently when a lock held by another thread on the same node was released.
NamespaceSerializer locks were added only to DDL operations which were seen to frequently fail with
"LockBusy" when run concurrently on the same database, such as dropCollection.

Global ResourceMutexes are the most recent, and are taken to serialize modifying specific config
collections, such as config.shards, config.chunks, and config.tags. For example, splitChunk,
mergeChunks, and moveChunk all take the chunk ResourceMutex.

# The logical clock and causal consistency

---

# Logical Sessions

Some operations, such as retryable writes and transactions, require durably storing metadata in the
cluster about the operation. However, it's important that this metadata does not remain in the
cluster forever.

Logical sessions provide a way to durably store metadata for the _latest_ operation in a sequence of
operations. The metadata is reaped if the cluster does not receive a new operation under the logical
session for a reasonably long time (the default is 30 minutes).

A logical session is identified by its "logical session id," or `lsid`. An `lsid` is a combination
of two pieces of information:

1. `id` - A globally unique id (UUID) generated by the mongo shell, driver, or the `startSession` server command
1. `uid` (user id) - The identification information for the logged-in user (if authentication is enabled)

The order of operations in the logical session that need to durably store metadata is defined by an
integer counter, called the `txnNumber`. When the cluster receives a retryable write or transaction
with a higher `txnNumber` than the previous known `txnNumber`, the cluster overwrites the previous
metadata with the metadata for the new operation.

Operations sent with an `lsid` that do not need to durably store metadata simply bump the time at
which the session's metadata expires.

## The logical session cache

The logical session cache is an in-memory cache of sessions that are open and in use on a certain
node. Each node (router, shard, config server) has its own in-memory cache. A cache entry contains:
1. `_id` - The session’s logical session id
1. `user` - The session’s logged-in username (if authentication is enabled)
1. `lastUse` - The date and time that the session was last used

The in-memory cache periodically persists entries to the `config.system.sessions` collection, known
as the "sessions collection." The sessions collection has different placement behavior based on
whether the user is running a standalone node, a replica set, or a sharded cluster.

| Cluster Type    | Sessions Collection Durable Storage                                                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standalone Node | Sessions collection exists on the same node as the in-memory cache.                                              |
| Replica Set     | Sessions collection exists on the primary node and replicates to secondaries.                                    |
| Sharded Cluster | Sessions collection is a regular sharded collection - can exist on multiple shards and can have multiple chunks. |

### Session expiration

There is a TTL index on the `lastUse` field in the sessions collection. The TTL expiration date is
thirty (30) minutes out by default, but is user-configurable. This means that if no requests come
in that use a session for thirty minutes, the TTL index will remove the session from the sessions
collection. When the logical session cache performs its periodic refresh (defined below), it will
find all sessions that currently exist in the cache that no longer exist in the sessions
collection. This is the set of sessions that we consider “expired.” The expired sessions are then
removed from the in-memory cache.

### How a session gets placed into the logical session cache

When a node receives a request with attached session info, it will place that session into the
logical session cache. If a request corresponds to a session that already exists in the cache, the
cache will update the cache entry's `lastUse` field to the current date and time.

### How the logical session cache syncs with the sessions collection

At a regular interval of five (5) minutes (user-configurable), the logical session cache will sync
with the sessions collection. Inside the class, this is known as the "refresh" function. There are
four steps to this process:

1. All sessions that have been used on this node since the last refresh will be upserted to the sessions collection. This means that sessions that already exist in the sessions collection will just have their `lastUse` fields updated.
1. All sessions that have been ended in the cache on this node (via the endSessions command) will be removed from the sessions collection.
1. Sessions that have expired from the sessions collection will be removed from the logical session cache on this node.
1. All cursors registered on this node that match sessions that have been ended (step 2) or were expired (step 3) will be killed.

### Periodic cleanup of the session catalog and transactions table

The logical session cache class holds the periodic job to clean up the session catalog and
transactions table. Inside the class, this is known as the "reap" function. Every five (5) minutes
(user-configurable), the following steps will be performed:

1. Find all sessions in the session catalog that were last checked out more than thirty minutes ago (default session expiration time).
1. For each session gathered in step 1, if the session no longer exists in the sessions collection (i.e. the session has expired or was explicitly ended), remove the session from the session catalog.
1. Find all entries in the transactions table that have a last-write date of more than thirty minutes ago (default session expiration time).
1. For each entry gathered in step 3, if the session no longer exists in the sessions collection (i.e. the session has expired or was explicitly ended), remove the entry from the transactions table.
