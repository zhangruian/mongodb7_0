// Keep "markers" against a collection to efficiently remove ranges of old records when the
// collection grows. This class is meant to be used only with collections that have the following
// requirements:
// * The collection is an insert-only collection
// * The collection has no indexes
// * If a record with RecordId=Max has to be deleted then all previous records with RecordId D such
// that Min < D <= Max should be deleted. With RecordID=Min defining a lower boundary.
//
// If these requirements hold then this class can be used to compute and maintain up-to-date markers
// for ranges of deletions. These markers will be expired and returned to the deleter whenever the
// implementation defined '_hasExcessMarkers' returns true.
//
// Some implementations can also provide utilities for expiring partially built markers if they
// implement '_hasPartialMarkerExpired'.

     * Markers are created by the class automatically whenever there are more than X number of bytes
     * between the previous marker and the latest insertion. Alternatively they can be created by
     * CollectionTruncateMarkers::createPartialMarkerIfNecessary if the implementation considers
     * that the current data awaiting a marker should be deleted anyways. This is useful in
     * time-based expiration systems as there could be low activity collections containing data that
     * should be expired but won't because there is no marker.
