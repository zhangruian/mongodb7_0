/**
 * This class is a container for all the collection resources which are currently acquired by a
 * given operation. Operations consist of one or more transactions, which "acquire" and "release"
 * collections within their lifetime.
 *
 * Transactions start either explicitly (through the construction of a WUOW) or implicitly, from the
 * moment the first collection is acquired. They last until the last collection snapshot is released
 * or the WriteUnitOfWork commits (whichever is longer).
 *
 * Because of the above definition, within a transaction, acquisitions are always 2-phase, meaning
 * that acquiring a collection and then releasing it will defer the release until the transaction
 * actually commits. The boundaries of the transaction are considered to be the WUOW. If there is no
 * WUOW, the transaction ends when the snapshot is released.
 *
 * There are three steps associated with each acquisition:
 *
 *  - Locking: Acquiring the necessary lock manager locks in order to ensure stability of the
 * snapshot for the duration of the acquisition.
 *  - Snapshotting: Taking a consistent snapshot across all the "services" associated with the
 * collection (shard filter, storage catalog, data snapshot).
 *  - Resource reservation: This is service-specific and indicates setting the necessary state so
 * that the snapshot is consistent for the duration of the acquisition. Example of resource
 * acquisition is the RangePreserver, which blocks orphan cleanups.
 *
 * Acquiring a collection performs all three steps: locking, resource reservation and snapshotting.
 *
 * Releasing a collection performs the inverse of acquisition, freeing locks, reservations and the
 * snapshot, such that a new acquire may see newer state (if the readConcern of the transaction
 * permits it).
 *
 * Yielding *all* transaction resources only frees locks and the snapshot, but it keeps the resource
 * reservations.
 *
 * Restoring *all* transaction resources only performs locking and snapshotting (in accordance with
 * the read concern of the operation).
