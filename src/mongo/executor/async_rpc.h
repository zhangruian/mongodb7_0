/**
 * Execute the command asynchronously on the given target with the provided executor.

 * The command type specified must have a `toBSON(BSONObj)` member function that transforms the
 * command into BSON suitable for sending over-the-wire. It also must have a nested `Reply` type
 * with a static `Reply parseSharingOwnership(BSONObj)` member function that parses BSON recieved in
 * response to the command into the `Reply` type. Note all IDL-defined command types meet these
 * requirements. Returns an ExecutorFuture with the reply from the IDL command.
 *
 * If there is any error, local or remote, while executing the command, the future is set with
 * ErrorCodes::RemoteCommandExecutionError. This is the only error returned by the API. Additional
 * information about the error, such as its provenance, code, whether it was a command-error or
 * write{concern}error, etc, is available in the ExtraInfo object attached to the error. See
 * async_rpc_error_info.h for details.
 *
 * Cancelling the source associated with the provided token will cancel any outstanding RPC work.
 * The `targeter` and optional `retryPolicy` arguments allow you to specify how to target the
 * command and when to retry it; see the class comments for those arguments for details. The default
 * retry policy is to not do any retries.
 *
 * The `opCtx` argument is used by NetworkEgressMetadataHooks to append operation-specific metadata
 * (i.e. potential cluster-time ticking). (TODO: SERVER-70191) Additionally, if the `opCtx` has an
 * attached baton, the baton may be used to run portions of the commands targeting logic and/or
 * retry logic, as well as process the network response.
