/**
 * A ticket broker between threads waiting (Ticket-waiters) and threads willing to give a ticket
 * (Ticket-releasers).
 *
 * This broker requires external synchronisation (growthLock) so that it can function correctly. The
 * methods that require synchronisation have their signature written so that it enforces correct
 * usage. Using it with a different mutex in two separate calls is undefined behaviour and will
 * almost certainly cause a deadlock or segmentation fault.
 *
 * This class is to be used when more than one broker is necessary in a given scope and certain
 * guarantees have to be made. Given the following conditions for usage:
 *
 * - Ticket-waiters must acquire the growthLock in order to enter the broker.
 * - Ticket-releasers must acquire the growthLock in order to transfer their ticket to a waiter in
 * the broker.
 *
 * Then this class can provide the following guarantees across the multiple instances of it in
 * scope:
 *
 * - Ticket-releasers can attempt to transfer their ticket to each broker only once. No other waiter
 * will appear between attempts.
 * - Ticket-waiters will get scheduled for execution once transferred a ticket without having to
 * acquire any mutex.
 *
 * This is useful for example if you need to build a scheduler based on top of multiple brokers
 * representing different groups of operations. The ticket-releasers can have "snapshot" guarantees
 * of the state of the system and choose who to transfer the ticket to based on some arbitrary
 * logic.
 *
 * Note that the implementation allows granular thread selection for wakeup but we've chosen to use
 * FIFO semantics to make the critical section as short lived as possible.
